## Installation

1. Download the `GameActivityControl.plugin.js`.
2. Place the `GameActivityControl.plugin.js` file into your BetterDiscord plugins folder.
3. Enable the plugin through the BetterDiscord settings.

## Usage

After installation, you can configure the games that you want to show or hide in your Discord activity status by following these steps:

1. **Open the Plugin Settings**: Navigate to the BetterDiscord settings and find the Game Activity Control plugin in the plugins list.
2. **Select Games**: If you see a message saying "No games found," make sure to run a game first so that Discord can detect it. Once a game is detected, it will appear in the settings when you reopen them.
3. **Toggle the switches** next to the games you want to display in your Discord activity. New games are shown by default.
4. **Hide Games**: To hide a game from your activity status, simply untoggle the switch next to it. You may need to tab into the game first before its presence gets hidden, but this is only necessary the first time of adding.
5. **Done**: After making your selections, click the "Done" button to apply your changes.
6. **Check Your Status**: Open Discord and check your activity status to ensure that only the selected games are displayed.

You can repeat these steps anytime you want to update your game visibility settings.
